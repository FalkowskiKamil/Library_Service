This code appears to be defining a simple database model for a book management system. The system has three main entities: Author, Book, and Shelf.

The first block of code defines the application and the database, and creates a shell context processor that will provide access to the database models within the application's shell.

The next block of code defines the Author model, which has an ID, a first name, a surname, and a relationship with the Book model. The Book model has an ID, a title, a description, a foreign key to the Author model, and a relationship with the Shelf model. The Shelf model has an ID, a status, and a foreign key to the Book model.

Each of these models has a __str__ method, which returns a string representation of the model instance.

Overall, this code provides the foundation for a book management system with database functionality, allowing users to add and view authors, books, and shelves.
